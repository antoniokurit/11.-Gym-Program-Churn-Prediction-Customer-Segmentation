# 11.-Gym-Program-Churn-Prediction-Customer-Segmentation

Model Fitness is a gym chain and we are tasked with predicting their churn rate for the next month. Our client wishes to implement a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.

In this project, we will predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer. We'll also draw up typical user portraits, identify target groups, select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features.

Furthermore, we will analyze the factors that impact churn most, draw conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service to cut churn.
